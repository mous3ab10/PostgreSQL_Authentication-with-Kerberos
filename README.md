# PostgreSQL_Authentication-with-Kerberos
### Steps To Setup Kerberos On UBUNTU :
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol used to verify the identity of two or more trusted hosts across an untrusted network. It uses secret-key cryptography and a trusted third party (Kerberos Key Distribution Center) for authenticating client-server applications. Key Distribution Cente (KDC) gives clients tickets representing their network credentials. The Kerberos ticket is presented to the servers after the connection has been established.
